    "This scheme was proposed by Dietzfelbinger and it generally addresses hashing from $w$-bit integers to $l$-bit integers.<br>\n",
    "After picking uniformly at random an odd $w$-bit integer $a$, it has to be computed $h_{a}:$[$2^{w}$] $\\rightarrow$ [$2^{l}$], as $h_{a}(x)$ = {($ax$ mod $2^{w}$)/$2^{w-l}$}.<br>\n",
    "With this schema, the numbers are stored as $bit$ $strings$, with the least significant bit to the right, so the integer division by a power of two would be represented as a $right$ $shift$. <br>\n",
    "It operates by extracting bits from $w-l$ to $w-1$, from the product $ax$, as illustrated: <br>\n",

    "$Claim$ <br>\n",
    "Multiply-shift is 2-universal, for $x \\ne y$, therefore <br>\n",
    "$Pr_{a \\in [2^{w}], odd}$ [$h_{a}(x) = h_{a}(y)$] $\\le 2/2^{l} = 2/m$. <p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "$Proof$ <br>\n",
    "$h_{a}(x) = h_{a}(y)$ is a collision which occurs only if $ax$ and $ay = ax + a(y-x)$ are the same on the bits $w-l,..,w-1$. <br>\n",
    "This match requires that bits $w-l,..,w-1$ of $(y-x)$ are either all 0s or 1s. <br>\n",
    "In order to have this condition fulfilled, two possible cases arise, when we add $a(y-x)$ to $ax$: if there's no carry, $h_{a}(x) = h_{a}(y)$ happens when all the bits $w-l,..,w-1$ of $a(y-x)$ are 0s; otherwise, if there's a carry, $h_{a}(x) = h_{a}(y)$ happens when all the bits are 1s.<br>     \n",
    "Therefore, to prove the claim is sufficient to prove that the probability that all bits $w-l,..,w-1$ of $a(y-x)$ are all 0s, or all 1s, is at most $2/2^{l}$. <p>\n",
    "\n",
    "$Fact$ $1.$ If $\\alpha$ is odd and $\\beta \\in [2^{q}]$ then $\\alpha\\beta \\equiv 0$ (mod $a^{q}$). <br>\n",
    "This exploit that any odd number $z$ is relatively prime to any power of two.<p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's define $b$ such that $a = 1 + 2b$, then $b$ is uniformly distributed in [$2^{w-1}$]. <br>\n",
    "Define $z$ to be the odd number satisfying $(y-x) = z2^{i}$, then $a(y-x) = z2^{i} + bz2^{i+1}$.<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"./files/claim.png\" /> <p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "It is remained to prove that $bz$ mod $2^{w-1}$ is uniformly distributed in $[2^{w-1}]$. <br>\n",
    "Note that there's a 1-1 correspondence between the $b \\in [2^{w-1}]$ and the products $bz$ mod $2^{w-1}$; for if there was another $b^{'} \\in [2^{w-1}]$ with $b^{'}z \\equiv bz$ (mod $2^{w-1}$) $\\iff$ $z(b^{'} - b) \\equiv 0$ (mod $2^{w-1}$), then this would contradict the fact 1, since $z$ is odd. <br>\n",
    "The uniform distribution on $b$ implies that $bz$ mod $2^{w-1}$ is uniformly distributed too. <br>\n",
    "This concludes that $a(y-x) = z2^{i} + bz2^{i+1}$ has bits set to $0$ until $i-1$, then a bit set to $1$ in position $i$ and a uniform distribution on bits $i+1,...,i+w-1$. <p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The collision $h_{a}(x) = h_{a}(y)$ happens when $ax$ and $ay= ax + a(y-x)$ are identical on bits $w-l,..,w-1$ <br>\n",
    "The two are always different in bit $i$, so if $i \\ge w-l$, there won't any collision, regardless of $a$.<br>\n",
    "However, if $i < w-l$, then because of carries there could be a collision if bits $w-l,..,w-1$ of $a(y-x)$ are either 0s or 1s. <br>\n",
    "Because of the uniform distribution, either this event happens with probability $1/2^{l}$, for a combined probability bounded by $2/2^{l}$, which completes the proof."
